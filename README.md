# Dijkstra's Algorithm Interactive Visualizer

This project involves the development of a Python-based interactive visualizer for **Dijkstra's Algorithm**. It demonstrates the shortest path algorithm's functionality in a graphical and intuitive manner, making it a useful educational tool for understanding graph theory and algorithmic problem-solving.

## Key Features

- **Graphical Representation**: Nodes and edges are visually rendered using Pygame, showcasing the relationships and weights in the graph.
- **Interactive Input**: Users can specify start and end nodes via input boxes, enabling dynamic calculation of the shortest path.
- **Path Visualization**: The shortest path is highlighted with a distinct color and thickness for better clarity.
- **Enhanced UI Design**: Improved aesthetics through a polished color scheme, semi-transparent weight labels, and structured layout for better user experience.
- **Algorithm Implementation**: The Dijkstra's Algorithm is implemented using a priority queue for efficient computation of shortest paths.
